PacMan

I decided to make an unconventional version of Pacman, where you can move the player with your mouse

Added features: 
- Changing the player to a pacman
- animating the pacman mouth
- Changing pacman direction according to mouvement
- rotating him up, down, right, left and in diagonal directions
(you can try to move him slowly to see his mouvement more clearly)
- adding obstacles
- preventing collision between pacman and obstacles
- changing obstacle opacity to give the illusion of the ghosts phasing through walls (the difficulty is harder if the ghosts phase through the walls)
- adjusting speed
- giving the ghosts a different shape 
//used guidance from a talented github individual to make the ghosts look nice :)
- fixed color selection and number selection for enemies
- made level selection and enemy selection distinct
- seeing score after losing
- Background Music
- Sound effect for when you get hit by a ghost
- Sound effect for eating
- Sound effect for game over

things to improve on:
- attempted to create projectiles firing at the ghosts for pacman to defend himself, however
I encountered many issues with the game context and I couldn't fix it
- smoother transitions
